## Tokenbound SDK
Houses the Tokenbound SDK, a front-end library for interacting with ERC-6551 accounts on Starknet. The SDK provides an interface for interacting with tokenbound accounts, enabling operations like account creation, transaction execution, token transfers (including ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-20 tokens), and message signing. Any onchain action you can perform with your EOA wallet can be done with your NFT's Tokenbound account.
